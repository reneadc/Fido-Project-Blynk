This repository contains all of the code for interfacing with a 16x2 Character I2C LCD Display. This accompanies my YouTube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5XhHYzUK0 

You can buy one of these great little I2C LCD Displays for just Â£4.99 on ryanteck.uk: https://ryanteck.uk/displays/11-16x2-character-i2c-lcd-display.html

Thanks for watching!
